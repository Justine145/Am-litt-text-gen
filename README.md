## American Literature Text Generator

### This repository contains a small personal project on text generation.

The aim was to train a model on a chapter from a classic American novel, Moby Dick. 
\
The LSTM based model is created using Keras.

Afterwards, the model is able to generate a new text based on a few given words (a seed).

The output can be displayed using the API Gradio (link, available for 48 hours).
